Data Analysis
  - process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming
      ~ gather, clean for analysis
      ~ using pandas
  - modeling data
      ~ inferential statistics to find out patterns
      ~ using pandas, visualizations
  - discover useful information
      ~ drive conclusions
      ~ data to information
  - informing conclusion, support decision-making
      ~ evidence of findings
      ~ reports depending on organizational roles

  > build statistical models and data visualizations
  > fixing incorrect values and removing invalid data
  > transforming data into an appropriate data structure


Data Analysis Process (non linear, more like a cycle)
  1. Data Extraction
    sql
    webscraping
    file formats (csv, json, xml)
    consulting APIs
    buying data
    distributed databases
  2. Data Cleaning
    missing values and empty data
    data imputation (substitute missing data)
    incorrect types
    incorrect or invalid data
    outliers and non relevant data
    statistical sanitation
  3. Data Wrangling (process of transforming and mapping data from raw to appropriate format)
    combining data
    heirarchical data
    handling categorical data
    reshaping and transforming structures
    indexing data for quick access
    merging, combining, and joining data
  4. Analysis (extract patterns from data, capture trends or anomalies)
    exploration
    building statistical models
    visualization and representations
    correlation vs causation analsis
    hypothesis testing
    statistical analysis
    reporting
  5. Action (how the analyzed data is consumed)
    building machine learning models
    feature engineering
    moving ML into production
    building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines
    live dashboard and reporting
    decision making and real-life tests


Data Analysis vs Data Science
- both have intersection
- Data Analysis is more targetted towards Exploratory Analysis,
  stronger storytelling and reporting


Python Libraries
- pandas: data analysis
- matplotlib: visualizations (main visualization library of other libraries)
- numpy: calculation
- seaborn: statistical visualization
- statsmodels: advanced statistical functions
- scipy: advanced statistical computing (optimization, linear algebra, image processing, etc.)
- scikit-learn: machine learning


Python+SQL = extremely required for Data Analysis
